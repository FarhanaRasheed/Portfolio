        Hello, I’m <strong>Farhana</strong>, a Master of Computer Applications (MCA)
        graduate of <strong>2025</strong>. I also hold a Bachelor of Computer
        Applications (BCA), which provided me with a strong foundation in software

      <p>
        I am passionate about <strong>web development</strong> and enjoy creating
        real-world applications. I have hands-on experience with PHP, Python,
        JavaScript, React, Next.js, and .NET Core Web API, and have worked on
        projects including placement management, charity management, and
        e-commerce systems.

        Along with certifications in <strong>Python for Data Science</strong> and
        <strong> Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking</strong>, and exposure to MERN
        Stack and DevOps, I am seeking a <strong>fresher role</strong> where I can
